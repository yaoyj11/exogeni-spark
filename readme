This is a java program that uses "Ahab" library to launch a slice on ExoGENI, and deploy a spark cluster in docker containers

To launch a spark cluster, you need to:

1. specify the location of your pem file and VM type ("XO Medium", "XO Large", etc.)in launchsparkcluster.sh

2. launch the cluster, run: ./launchsparkcluster.sh sliceNAME spark  #VM
$./launchsparkcluster.sh sparkcluster1 spark 4 

3. The master node of spark cluster lies in "node0", workers lie in "node1", "node2",etc.
To login into the container, login to the VM, and run:
$docker exec -it sparkserver "/bin/bash"
